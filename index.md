## The Reyna Lab at Emory University

We are a research group in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html) and the [Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology](https://med.emory.edu/departments/pharmacology-chemical-biology/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu).

Our group combines approaches from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering to address the interesting and important problems that arise in those areas in the context and service of biology and medicine.

Please see our [people](people), [projects](projects), [publications](publications) pages for more information about who we are and what we do. If you are interested in joining our lab, then please see the [lab expectations](expectations) page. If you are interested in our courses, department, and program, then see my [teaching](teaching) and [BMI FAQ](bmi_faq) pages for students.
