## The Reyna Lab at Emory University

We are a research group in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://med.emory.edu/departments/biomedical-informatics/index.html) and the [Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology](https://med.emory.edu/departments/pharmacology-chemical-biology/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu).

Our group combines approaches from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering to address the interesting and important problems that arise in those areas in the context and service of biology and medicine.
