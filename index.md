<title>Reyna Lab</title>
## The Reyna Lab at Emory University

We are (probably about to be) a research group in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.bmi.emory.edu/) and the [Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology](https://med.emory.edu/departments/pharmacology-chemical-biology/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu).

We combine approaches from mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, and medicine to address biological and clinical questions in a principled and meaningful way.

This website, much like this research group, is under development.
