## <a name="health"></a>Health and Wellness

### Feeling sick? Stay home (and feel better soon).
If you are not feeling well, or have not felt well in the past week, then please do not come to campus. Your instructors and advisors can accommodate you, and they would be happy to accommodate you instead of risking your health or the health of others. Please see [Emory's current COVID-19 guidance](https://www.emory.edu/forward/covid-19/if-you-feel-sick.html) for details.

### COVID-19
If you have COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19 symptoms, or were exposed to COVID-19, then please do not come to campus, and please contact Student Health. Please see [Emory's current COVID-19 guidance](https://www.emory.edu/forward/covid-19/if-you-feel-sick.html) for details. [COVID-19 testing](https://www.emory.edu/forward/covid-19/testing/schedule-covid-test.html) is free through Emory. Your privacy will be protected. Your instructors and advisors can accommodate you when you are sick.

### Accommodations
Emory University complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. If you are registered with the [Department of Accessibility Services](https://accessibility.emory.edu/students/index.html) and would like to receive accommodations for a course, then please inform your instructor as soon as possible. Any information about disabilities or accommodations will be kept as confidential as possible.

### Safety and Inclusion
Our goal is to create a safe and inclusive environment. If we mispronounce your name, use an incorrect pronoun, etc., then please correct us. If you do not feel safe, then please inform your instructor, advisor, or another trusted faculty member. Emory faculty are mandatory [Title IX](https://equityandinclusion.emory.edu/title-ix/index.html) reporters, i.e., we are obligated by law to inform the Title IX coordinator at Emory about sexual harassment and misconduct.

### Support Services
You are important, and we want you to do well in your courses, in your research, and in life. If you are struggling with emotional, psychological, or other issues that threaten your success, then please contact [Emoryâ€™s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](http://counseling.emory.edu/index.html). CAPS services are free to Emory students. Emory provides a variety of support services, including 24/7-assistance through Student Intervention Services at (404)-430-1120. We understand that life happens outside of the classroom and the lab. If you suffer a tragedy, then please know that you can reach out to us, CAPS, and Student Health Services for help.

## <a name="policies"></a>Policies

### Handbooks
The current Laney Graduate School (LGS) [Handbook](https://gs.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/handbook/handbook.pdf) describes the policies of the graduate school, and the current Computer Science and Informatics (CSI) Graduate Program [Handbook](https://www.cs.emory.edu/site/doc/CSI-Handbook.pdf) describes the policies of the graduate program. We recommend that you read both (at least) once at the beginning of the program.

### Courses
The CSI PhD Program has three required courses and four elective courses. See the [Handbook](https://www.cs.emory.edu/site/doc/CSI-Handbook.pdf) for these courses.

### Tracks
There are two tracks in the CSI PhD Program: the BMI track and the CS track. The only difference between these tracks are the options for required and elective courses. You can satisfy either the BMI track or the CS track (or both) regardless of your advisor's home department, but we recommend that you choose courses in consultation with your advisor.

### Transfer courses, Course Substitutions, and Cross-Enrollment
You may be able to use courses that you took at other institutions to satisfy some of your course requirements through course transfers or course substitions. You cannot transfer courses that satisfied any degree requirements at another institution, and you cannot transfer more than 9 credit hours of courses, but these limitations do not apply to course substitions. You cannot use course substitions to reach the required number of credit hours, but this is not a problem for PhD students because PhD students take at least 9 credit hours of courses each semester, even when they are "only" doing research.

You can enroll at courses at Georgia Tech and other nearby institutions. You need to complete an [application](https://registrar.emory.edu/registration/cross-registration/emory-students.html) before the deadline. 

### Milestones and Deadlines

## <a name="thesis"></a>Thesis and Dissertation

### Dissertation Template
Emory expects you to format your dissertation in a specific way. Pay attention to the details to avoid a back-and-forth near the deadline: [instructions](https://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/completion/submit/phd-completion.html) and [more instructions](https://www.gs.emory.edu/_includes/documents/submitting-your-thesis-or-dissertation-guidelines-and-template-_word-documents-_-new-dean.docx). You can use the [LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/emory-laney-graduate-school-dissertation-template/hjszzmrwswkv) and [Word template](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for your dissertation.

### Copyright: You likely need permission to include your published work in your thesis.
When you publish your work, you typically transfer some rights to the publisher of your work, which can make it more difficult to include parts of your work, including your figures, in your thesis. Contrary to popular belief, the material in your thesis is not necessarily protected by the "Fair Use" doctrine. If someone else holds the copyright to your work, then you may need to ask them for permission to include it in your thesis, which can take months to do. If you wait until the last minute to obtain permission, then you may need to remove material from your dissertation and/or delay your graduation. This is not an exaggeration. This [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTCWefykLvUAs8NMMrbqIIn120jtFkVWPEL78hEmyRU) provides more detailed guidance.

## <a name="questions"></a>Questions or concerns?
We encourage any struggling student to reach out to their advisor, another trusted faculty member, the DGS or a co-DGS, the Department Chair, the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs in LGS, and/or Student Health Services for support.

For some issues, you may prefer to contact your instructor or advisor. For other issues, you may want to contact one of the department, graduate program, or graduate school administrators. When in doubt, please feel free to ask me as the current Vice Chair for Education and Training for BMI and a co-DGS for the CSI graduate program.
