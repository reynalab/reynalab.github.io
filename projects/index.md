## Projects

I primarily research mathematical models and algorithms for health and healthcare, but I am broadly interested in the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering and the interesting problems that arise in those areas in the context of biology and medicine.

I am a co-organizer of the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](https://physionetchallenges.org/) with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/). The Challenges are annual competitions that invite researchers to develop algorithmic approaches for addressing clinical problems. For the Challenges, we source and release real-world datasets and define clinically motivated problems to encourage and support the development of open-source and reproducible computational methods. The Challenges result in large public datasets and dozens of publications and open-source algorithms.

I am also interested in computational biology and computational cancer genomics. I research computational methods for identifying driver alterations in cancer from large-scale sequencing studies with various prior biological hypotheses and prior knowledge of biological pathways. In particular, I develop, apply, and analyze computational methods for detecting and characterizing [targetable protein-protein interactions](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2/centers#emory-university-preceding) in cancer.

My recent [publications](../publications) illustrate many of my research interests, especially papers for which I am one of the first first or last authors.
