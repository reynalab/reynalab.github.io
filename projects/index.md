## Projects

I study mathematical and statistical models and algorithms for health and healthcare, and I am broadly interested in the intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering and the interesting and important problems that arise in those areas in the context and service of biology and medicine.

I am a co-organizer of the [George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges](https://physionetchallenges.org/) with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/). The Challenges are annual competitions that invite researchers to develop algorithmic approaches for addressing clinical problems. For the Challenges, we source and release real-world datasets and define clinically motivated problems to encourage and support the development of open-source and reproducible computational methods. The Challenges result in large public datasets and dozens of publications and open-source algorithms.

My recent [publications](../publications) illustrate many of my research interests, especially papers for which I am one of the first authors or one of the last authors.
