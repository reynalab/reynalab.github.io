## CS 584: Deep Learning

__What is deep learning?__  
Deep learning is a type of machine learning and an approach to artificial intelligence. By building complex representations of the world in terms of simpler ones, deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, clinical applications, and other areas &mdash; promising (and threatening) to transform society.

__What is this course?__  
This graduate course introduces students to the theory and practice of deep learning. By the end of the course, student should understand fundamental concepts and foundational work in the field, know how to choose between and implement different deep learning models to solve substantive problems, and be able to evaluate and critique work that uses deep learning techniques.

__What is this webpage?__
